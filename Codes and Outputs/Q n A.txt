They are important in computer graphics because they help artists and animators create animations .

How do you handle timing and frame rates in OpenGL animation?:Timing and frame rates in OpenGL animation are managed by controlling the rate at which frames are rendered and updating object transformations accordingly. This often involves synchronizing animation updates with the system's refresh rate to ensure smooth motion.

What are keyframes, and how do they influence animation in computer graphics?: Keyframes are specific frames within an animation sequence that define the state of objects at particular points in time. They serve as reference points for interpolation between poses or states, influencing the overall motion and appearance of the animation.

Explain the concept of interpolation in animation.: Interpolation in animation involves calculating intermediate values between keyframes to smoothly transition between poses or states over time. This can include linear interpolation (LERP), bezier interpolation, or other methods to achieve desired motion curves.
